- Include instructions on how to install dependencies and run the project.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correctness: Does the UI work as expected?
- Aesthetics: Is the UI pleasant and easy to use?
- Code Quality: Is your code clean, well-organized, and documented?

### Optional

- An auxiliary slide deck that summarizes your approach.

### Extra Credits

Only try to implement any of these if you are certain that the main task is already the most beautiful and functional file manager frontend in the world.
 - OpenAPI definition for the backend + automatic generation of frontend api code

## Important Notes

Avoid using `GET /directories/tree`, its recursive query is not tested at all.

You can get 'inspiration' from any page out there, make sure to add your own twist to it we don't want just a copy paste of an open source project out there.
